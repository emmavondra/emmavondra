## About Me

I am currently a full-time student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,  studying to recieve a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. I believe in the importance of society, people, and making advances in the world in order to make life easier for the future generations.  In addition to making improvements, I would like to see an advancement of women in engineering. Through my courses that I am enrolled in, I plan to use them to advance my knowledge in both the classroom and during my internship with Kiewit during the upcoming summer. I am also involved in ASCE as a Concrete Canoe Co-captian, SALT and other clubs to further my education aligning with engineering and leadership opportunities.
